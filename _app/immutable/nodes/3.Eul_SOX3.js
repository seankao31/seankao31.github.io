I quit my job in May 2025 and decided I’m done with the 9-to-5 life. I’ve got a few ideas for how I could work for myself, but no solid plan yet.</p> <p>I enjoy creating <em>stuff</em>. My background is in programming, but I’m drawn to creative work in general — world-building, writing, game development, character design, drawing, 3D modeling, music, and animation. I’m not claiming to be good at all of them — or any of them, for that matter. I just love exploring how they’re made, and I’d love to get a proper handle on them myself someday.</p> <p><strong>What’s life without a few obsessions to grind and side quests to chase? :)</strong></p> <h4 id="️-deep-dive"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#️-deep-dive"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>☕️ Deep Dive</h4> <p>WIP</p> <h4 id="-full-lore"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#-full-lore"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>📑 Full Lore</h4> <p>I’m not even sure if this section is warranted.</p> <hr> <h2 id="about-the-site"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#about-the-site"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>About the Site</h2> <p>Website modified from <a href="https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter</a></p>',1);function c(e){var i=s();t(l=>{a.title="About"}),n(28),o(e,i)}export{c as component};
