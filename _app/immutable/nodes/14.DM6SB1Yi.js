It’s not a complete archive of everything I’ve ever read; it’s simply a record of the books that stayed with me. I’d love to remember every single title and retroactively attach a “finished on” date, but after nearly a decade of active reading... that’s probably impossible.</p> <p>A note on my ratings: they’re scored on a 1–10 scale and reflect how much a book personally mattered to me and how much I enjoyed it — not how “objectively good” I think it is. A book can be excellent at what it sets out to do yet still receive a modest score if it didn’t leave a lasting impact on my worldview. Conversely, some books are mind-shifting and deeply impactful even if the prose is clumsy or downright painful to get through — and in those cases, I tend to rate them higher than their writing alone deserves. Practical or highly specific books can be useful in the moment, but unless they meaningfully change how I think or who I am, their scores simply land lower within this system.</p> <p>The scale is closer to <a href="https://www.japantravelpros.com/blog/star-ratings-reviews-japan-is-different">Japanese restaurant reviews</a> than Western Goodreads-style ones: a 5 or 6 means good (like a typical 4.5/5), 7 or 8 means great, and anything above 8 is truly exceptional.</p></article> <div class="reading-container svelte-1hbuko3"><div class="book-list svelte-1hbuko3"></div></div>',1);function F(b,c){A(c,!0);function w(e){return"★".repeat(e)+"☆".repeat(10-e)}function k(e){return Array.isArray(e)?e.join(", "):e}var v=T();P(e=>{q.title="Reading"});var m=d($(v),4),p=i(m);H(p,21,()=>c.data.books,J,(e,r)=>{var o=S();const u=G(()=>k(a(r).author));var n=i(o),_=i(n,!0);t(n);var s=d(n,2),I=i(s,!0);t(s);var l=d(s,2),x=i(l,!0);t(l),t(o),C(j=>{h(_,a(r).title),g(s,"title",a(u)),h(I,a(u)),g(l,"aria-label",`${a(r).rating??""} out of 10 stars`),h(x,j)},[()=>w(a(r).rating)]),f(e,o)}),t(p),t(m),f(b,v),R()}export{F as component};
