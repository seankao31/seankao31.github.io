I quit my job in May 2025 and decided I’m done with full-time work. From now on, I want to work for myself.

I watch and read a lot of Japanese content, and much of what I’m into is only really available in Japanese. So I’m learning it mainly to understand what I enjoy — not so much to speak or write it.</p> <h6 id="reading"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#reading"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Reading</h6> <ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195853498-get-better-at-anything?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=bCcMIBDlN6&amp;rank=1" rel="nofollow"><em>Get Better at Anything: 12 Maxims for Mastery</em> by Scott H.
