# Hi, I'm Yshan :)

A bit about myself...

#### ⚡️ Quick Scan

Some quick bullet points:

- Born and living in Taiwan
- Studied and worked in the U.S. for a while
- Majored in computer science, worked as a software engineer
- Loves reading, gaming, storytelling, piano, and art
- Aspiring game developer and storyteller

I’m still figuring things out. I quit my job in May 2025 and decided I’m done with the 9-to-5 life. I’ve got a few ideas for how I could work for myself, but no solid plan yet.

I enjoy creating _stuff_. My background is in programming, but I'm drawn to creative work in general — world-building, writing, game development, character design, drawing, 3D modeling, music, and animation. I'm not claiming to be good at all of them — or any of them, for that matter. I just love exploring how they’re made, and I’d love to get a proper handle on them myself someday.

**What’s life without a few obsessions to grind and side quests to chase? :)**

I'm not even sure if this section is warranted.
