# What am I up to?

I’m still figuring things out. I quit my job in May 2025 and decided I’m done with full-time work. I’ve got a few ideas of what to try to work for myself, but no solid plan yet.

###### Building [this very website](https://www.yhkao.com)

I said “building,” but I’ve accepted that I probably won’t settle on a design anytime soon. For now, I’m focusing on the content, because that’s what really matters.

###### Game dev

I’m making a game. Not _my_ game, just _a_ game. It’s heavily inspired by _Slay the Spire_ — I’m essentially replicating its design to get hands-on experience with the Godot engine. Along the way, I’m experimenting with writing dev logs and might even turn it into one of those _“I remade \*insert famous game title\* from scratch”_ YouTube videos.

###### Learning Japanese

I'm working toward JLPT N4 now, and soon N3. I watch and read a lot of Japanese content, and much of what I’m into is only really available in Japanese. So I’m learning it mainly to understand what I enjoy — not so much to speak or write it.
